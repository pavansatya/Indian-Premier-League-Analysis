# Indian Premier League Analysis

Indian Premier League is a twenty-twenty cricket tournament played between 10 franchises from players across all cricketing nations. 

### <ins>Data Collection</ins> 
Gathered comprehensive data of matches played from 2008 to 2022 containing (ball-to-ball stats), I obtained this data from the cricket database & official IPL web page. This data is organised in CSV format. 

### <ins>Data Loading</ins> 
Imported the data into the Power BI desktop using the ‘Get Data’ option in Power BI 

### <ins>Data Modelling</ins> 
Now, I have created relationships between different tables to define key performance metrics like player batting, bowing averages, strike rates, team performance etc. 

### <ins>Dashboard Design</ins> 
Created visualisations representing individual and team performances, achievements, and trophies over the years. We can use bar charts, scatter plots, tablets etc., based on the data type you need to display. Filters, drop-down menus & slicers are created to enable users to explore the data based on specific criteria 

### <ins>Player performance visual</ins> 
We can also see individual player performances, filters are implemented to allow users to select specific players and see their performance across seasons.

### <ins>Testing & refinement</ins> 
We can test our report using manual testing. In manual testing, we can check the data by counting using the count method or sum, aggregation and validate our calculations. Based on user feedback, I optimise dashboard layout and visualisations to refine my database.
